    <h3>Drawing fractals one random point at a time</h3>

      <p>
        A chaos game is a relatively simple iterative process. Given a
        shape and a ratio, choose an initial position. Now, pick a
        random vertex from this shape. The next position is found by
        drawing a vector from from the current position to the
        randomly chosen vertex and scaling that vector by the ratio.
        Recurse.

      <p>
        We can write this using a recurrence relation.
        Let <code>v[n]</code> represent the output of a random process
        where the <code>n</code>th value is a random vertex from our
        shape (assume vertices and points are represented by vectors
        obeying normal vector math):
      </p>
      <p>
        <code>
          p[0] = p<sub>0</sub> <br />
          p[n+1] = p[n] + r*(v[n] - p[n])
          </code>
      </p>
    <p>
      Let's start with a classic example: the Sierpi≈Ñski triangle.  This
      is obtained by choosing a regular triangle as our shape  and a ratio of <code>1/2</code>.
